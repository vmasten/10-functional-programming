2. Be sure to run "npm i" to install any missing dependencies in the working directory
3. Run "nodemon" in order to start the server and allow it to listen for any changes
4. Navigate to localhost:3000 in order to see the index page. localhost:3000/new-article and localhost:3000/admin to create a new post and see administrative stats respectively

## Architecture
Uses a combination of HTML/CSS, JavaScript with jQuery, Handlebars.js, node.js (with express, fs, and pg), highlight.js, JSON, and Postgres.

MDN was a big help, as was Stack Overflow and a few other random sites that helped me get unstuck at times.
