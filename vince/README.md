## Overview
This application is a portable blogging platform that rebuilds an existing database of blog articles from a local .json file and allows the user to add their own.

## Getting Started
1. Download the repo
2. Be sure to run "npm i" to install any missing dependencies in the working directory
3. Run "nodemon" in order to start the server and allow it to listen for any changes
4. Navigate to localhost:3000 in order to see the index page. localhost:3000/new-article and localhost:3000/admin to create a new post and see administrative stats respectively

## Architecture
Uses a combination of HTML/CSS, JavaScript with jQuery, Handlebars.js, node.js (with express, fs, and pg), highlight.js, JSON, and Postgres.

## Credits and Collaborations
MDN was a big help, as was Stack Overflow and a few other random sites that helped me become unstuck at times.
